## Biological Organization and Cell Theory

> [!DEFINITION] Cell Theory:
> The cell is an **open system** that represents the **fundamental unit of life** (organization and activity). All cells derive from other cells.

* **Biological Hierarchy:** Cells $\to$ Tissues $\to$ Organs $\to$ Organ Systems $\to$ Organism.

## Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

* **Basic Cell Components (Shared by all cells):**
    1.  **Plasma membrane:** Outer covering.
    2.  **Cytoplasm:** Cytosol plus suspended structures.
    3.  **DNA:** Genetic material.
    4.  **Ribosomes:** Synthesize proteins.

> [!DEFINITION] Cell Types:
> * **Prokaryotes:** Lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. $\text{DNA}$ is in a central **nucleoid** region.
> * **Eukaryotes:** Possess a **true nucleus** and membrane-bound organelles.

## The Plasma Membrane and Cell Size

> [!DEFINITION] Plasma Membrane:
> A $6-8~\text{nm}$ thick, **double layer of phospholipid molecules** ($\text{lipid bilayer}$) that is fluid and semipermeable.

The membrane maintains cell integrity and controls the passage of materials. It is composed of:
* **Phospholipids:** Consist of a **hydrophilic head** and two **hydrophobic tails**.
* **Proteins:** Function as channels, receptors, carriers, and identification markers.
* **Cholesterol:** Helps maintain membrane integrity and fluidity.

> [!WARNING] Surface-Area-to-Volume Ratio:
> Cells must be small because as they grow, the **surface-area-to-volume ratio drops**. The membrane's surface area cannot support the metabolic needs of the volume.

* **Example (Microvilli):** Nutrient-absorbing cells use **microvilli** (fingerlike projections) to increase plasma membrane surface area.

## Cytoskeleton

* **Cytoskeleton Function:** Maintains cell shape, internal organization, and provides mechanical support (division and movement).

| Filament Type | Diameter | Protein | Core Function |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Microtubules** | $\sim 25~\text{nm}$ | **Tubulin** | Largest; structural support, transport. |
| **Intermediate filaments** | $\sim 10~\text{nm}$ | Various | Mid-sized; mechanical strength. |
| **Actin filaments** | $\sim 6~\text{nm}$ | **Actin** | Smallest; cell motility, contraction. |

## Organelles and Endomembrane System (Eukaryotes)

> [!DEFINITION] Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):
> A double-membrane organelle of interconnected sacs ($\text{cisternae}$).
> * **Smooth ER ($\text{SER}$):** Synthesis/storage of lipids and steroids; detoxification.
> * **Rough ER ($\text{RER}$):** Covered in ribosomes where proteins are synthesized.

* **Golgi Apparatus:** Responsible for **labelling and delivery** of proteins and lipids.
* **Membrane Transport:** Includes **Endocytosis** (engulfing) and **Exocytosis** (releasing contents).

## Energy Organelles and Endosymbiont Theory

> [!IMPORTANT] Energy Organelles:
> * **Mitochondria ("powerhouses"):** Produce **ATP** ($\text{cellular respiration}$). Inner membrane forms **cristae**.
> * **Chloroplasts (Plant Cells):** Capture solar energy for sugars ($\text{photosynthesis}$). Contain internal **thylakoid membranes**.

> [!DEFINITION] Endosymbiont Theory:
> Mitochondria (from **aerobic prokaryotes**) and chloroplasts (from **photosynthetic prokaryotes**) originated as bacteria engulfed by larger cells.

## Plant Cell Specific Features

* **Plant Cell Wall:** Surrounds the plasma membrane, providing **tensile strength and protection**. Composed of cellulose microfibrils, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin.
* **Plant Vacuoles:** Help regulate water and storage of molecules.
