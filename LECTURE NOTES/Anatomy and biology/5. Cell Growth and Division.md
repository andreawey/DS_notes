## Cell Growth and Division Overview

> [!DEFINITION] Cell Types:
> * **Somatic Cells:** General body cells. Most divide (except red blood cells, most neurons, and some muscle cells). They are **diploid**, containing 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes (46 total).
> * **Gametes:** Sex cells (sperm and eggs). They are **haploid** ($1n$), containing half the number of chromosomes.

* **Chromosomes:** Humans have 46 chromosomes. Each somatic cell has two copies of each chromosome (one from each parent), forming **homologous pairs**.
* **Diploidy:** The condition of having pairs of chromosomes.

## The Cell Cycle

The cycle is divided into two major phases: **Interphase** and the **Mitotic (M) Phase**.

### Interphase
Preparatory phases where the cell grows and copies its DNA.
1.  **$G_1$ Phase (First Gap):** Cell grows physically larger, copies organelles, and accumulates molecular building blocks.
2.  **S Phase (Synthesis):** Cell synthesizes a complete copy of its DNA and duplicates the **centrosome** (microtubule-organizing structure).
3.  **$G_2$ Phase (Second Gap):** Cell grows more, makes proteins/organelles, and reorganizes contents for mitosis. Ends when mitosis begins.

### M Phase (Mitotic)
Involves two distinct processes:
* **Mitosis:** Nuclear DNA condenses into visible chromosomes and is pulled apart by the mitotic spindle.
* **Cytokinesis:** The cytoplasm splits to form two new cells.

> [!NOTE] Cytokinesis Differences:
> * **Animal Cells:** A contractile ring of cytoskeletal fibers forms a **cleavage furrow** that pinches the cell in two.
> * **Plant Cells:** Stiffer due to cell walls. A **cell plate** (new plasma membrane and cell wall components) builds down the middle to partition the cell.

## Mitosis vs. Meiosis

> [!IMPORTANT] Comparison of Goals:
> * **Mitosis:** Produces two **genetically identical** diploid daughter cells. Used for growth and repair.
> * **Meiosis:** Produces four **genetically unique** haploid gametes. Used for sexual reproduction.

### Meiosis Process
A two-step division process (Meiosis I and Meiosis II).
* **Meiosis I:** Separates homologous pairs.
    * **Prophase I:** Homologues pair up and trade parts via **Crossing Over**.
    * **Metaphase I:** Homologue pairs (not individual chromosomes) line up at the metaphase plate.
    * **Anaphase I:** Homologues are pulled apart; sister chromatids remain attached.
* **Meiosis II:** Separates sister chromatids (similar to mitosis), resulting in haploid cells with non-duplicated chromosomes.

> [!NOTE] Sources of Genetic Variation:
> 1.  **Crossing Over:** Homologues exchange genetic material at random points, creating "remixed" chromosomes with unique allele combinations.
> 2.  **Random Orientation:** Homologue pairs line up randomly during Metaphase I, allowing for many different assortments of chromosomes in gametes.

## Cell Cycle Control: Checkpoints

> [!DEFINITION] Checkpoint:
> A stage where the cell examines internal/external cues to decide whether to proceed with division.

* **$G_1$ Checkpoint:** The main decision point. Checks for **size**, **nutrients**, **molecular signals** (growth factors), and **DNA integrity**.
* **$G_2$ Checkpoint:** Occurs before M phase. Checks for **DNA integrity** (damage) and **DNA replication completeness**.
    * If damage is irreparable, the cell undergoes **apoptosis** (programmed cell death) to prevent cancer.
* **Spindle (M) Checkpoint:** Occurs during metaphase. Checks if all chromosomes are firmly attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles. Pauses mitosis if "straggler" chromosomes are detected.

## Cell Signaling

Cells communicate via chemical signals (ligands) binding to receptors.

* **Paracrine Signaling:** Communication over short distances between neighbors (e.g., during development).
* **Synaptic Signaling:** A specialized paracrine signaling between nerve cells using **neurotransmitters** released into a synaptic cleft.
* **Endocrine Signaling:** Long-distance communication via the circulatory system using **hormones** (e.g., thyroid, pituitary, gonads).
* **Autocrine Signaling:** A cell signals itself (binds to its own receptors).
* **Direct Contact:** Signaling across **gap junctions** (animals) or **plasmodesmata** (plants), or via surface protein binding (e.g., immune system recognition of "self").

## Homeostasis and Feedback

> [!DEFINITION] Homeostasis:
> The tendency to maintain a stable internal environment (temperature, pH, glucose).

* **Negative Feedback Loops:** The primary mechanism for homeostasis.
    * **Example (Temperature):** Body heat exceeds $37^\circ\text{C}$ $\to$ Sensors alert brain $\to$ Sweat glands activated $\to$ Body cools.
    * **Example (Blood Sugar):** High glucose $\to$ Pancreas releases **insulin** $\to$ Cells take up glucose. Low glucose $\to$ Pancreas releases **glucagon** $\to$ Liver breaks down glycogen.
    * **Diabetes:** Failure to regulate blood sugar due to lack of insulin (Type 1) or receptor failure (Type 2).

## Cellular Differentiation

> [!DEFINITION] Transcription Factors:
> Proteins that bind to specific genes to promote or inhibit transcription ("on" or "off"), regulating gene expression and determining a cell's specialized identity.

### Stem Cells
Unspecialized cells that can divide and differentiate.
* **Totipotent:** Can form *any* cell type (e.g., zygote).
* **Pluripotent:** Can form any body tissue but not a full organism (e.g., embryonic stem cells).
* **Multipotent:** Can form cells within a specific lineage (e.g., **hematopoietic stem cells** in bone marrow make blood cells).
* **Oligopotent/Unipotent:** Limited differentiation potential.
