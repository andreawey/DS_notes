## Metabolism and Energy

> [!DEFINITION] Metabolism:
> The totality of an organism's chemical reactions. It is an emergent property of life that arises from orderly interactions between molecules.

* **Metabolic Pathways:** A specific molecule is altered in a series of steps, resulting in a product. Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.

| Pathway Type | Description | Energy Change | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Catabolic** | Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler compounds. | Releases energy (**Exergonic**) | Cellular Respiration |
| **Anabolic** | Consumption of energy to build complex molecules from simpler ones. | Consumes energy (**Endergonic**) | Protein Synthesis |

## ATP: The Cell's Energy Shuttle

> [!IMPORTANT] ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):
> The cell's energy shuttle. It is composed of a ribose (sugar), adenine (nitrogenous base), and three phosphate groups.

* **Hydrolysis:** The bonds between the phosphate groups can be broken by hydrolysis. Energy is released when the terminal phosphate bond is broken.
* **Energy Coupling:** The use of an exergonic process (like ATP hydrolysis) to drive an endergonic one. ATP drives cellular work (chemical, transport, and mechanical) by coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions.
* **Regeneration:** ATP is a renewable resource regenerated by adding a phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).

## Cellular Respiration

> [!DEFINITION] Cellular Respiration:
> A set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.

* **Formula:** $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{Energy (ATP + heat)}$
* **Redox Reactions:** Respiration involves the transfer of electrons.
    * **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons (Glucose is oxidized).
    * **Reduction:** Gain of electrons (Oxygen is reduced).
    * **Electron Carriers:** $NAD^+$ and $FAD$ function as electron carriers (oxidizing agents) during respiration. They accept electrons to become $NADH$ and $FADH_2$.

### Stages of Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration occurs in three main stages:
1.  **Glycolysis** (breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate)
2.  **Pyruvate Oxidation & Citric Acid Cycle** (completes the breakdown of glucose)
3.  **Oxidative Phosphorylation** (accounts for most of the ATP synthesis)

## Stage 1: Glycolysis

> [!NOTE] Location:
> Occurs in the **Cytoplasm**. It does *not* require Oxygen.

Glycolysis ("sugar splitting") breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. It occurs in two major phases:
* **Energy Investment Phase:** 2 ATP are used to phosphorylate glucose intermediates.
* **Energy Payoff Phase:** 4 ATP are synthesized (substrate-level phosphorylation) and 2 $NADH$ are produced.

> [!IMPORTANT] Net Yield of Glycolysis:
> * 2 Pyruvate
> * 2 $H_2O$
> * 2 ATP
> * 2 $NADH + 2H^+$

## Stage 2: Pyruvate Oxidation and the Citric Acid Cycle

> [!NOTE] Location:
> Occurs in the **Mitochondrion** (in Eukaryotes). Presence of $O_2$ is required.

### Pyruvate Oxidation
Before the Citric Acid Cycle can begin, pyruvate must be converted to **Acetyl Coenzyme A (Acetyl CoA)**. This step links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.
* A carboxyl group is removed as $CO_2$.
* Electrons are transferred to $NAD^+$ to form $NADH$.
* Coenzyme A is attached.

### The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)
The cycle oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate. It has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. The acetyl group of Acetyl CoA joins the cycle by combining with oxaloacetate, forming citrate. The next seven steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate, making the process a cycle.

**Yield per turn (for 1 Pyruvate):**
* 1 ATP
* 3 $NADH$
* 1 $FADH_2$
* 2 $CO_2$ (waste)

> [!WARNING] Total Yield per Glucose:
> Since 1 Glucose produces 2 Pyruvates, the cycle turns twice. Total yield: **2 ATP, 6 $NADH$, 2 $FADH_2$**.

## Stage 3: Oxidative Phosphorylation

> [!DEFINITION] Oxidative Phosphorylation:
> The production of ATP using energy derived from the redox reactions of an electron transport chain. It accounts for almost 90% of the ATP generated by respiration.

This stage consists of two coupled processes:
1.  **Electron Transport Chain (ETC):**
    * Located in the **inner mitochondrial membrane** (cristae).
    * Electrons drop in free energy as they go down the chain and are finally passed to $O_2$, forming $H_2O$.
    * The chain itself generates no ATP directly. Its function is to break the large free-energy drop from food to $O_2$ into smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts.
    * Electron transfer causes proteins to pump $H^+$ from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.

2.  **Chemiosmosis:**
    * The use of energy in a $H^+$ gradient to drive cellular work.
    * $H^+$ moves back across the membrane, passing through the protein complex **ATP Synthase**.
    * ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of $H^+$ to drive the phosphorylation of ATP.

## Fermentation

> [!DEFINITION] Fermentation:
> A partial degradation of sugars that occurs without $O_2$. It consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate $NAD^+$, which can be reused by glycolysis.

Two common types:
* **Alcohol Fermentation:** Pyruvate is converted to ethanol in two steps, releasing $CO_2$. (Used in brewing/baking).
* **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Pyruvate is reduced directly by $NADH$ to form lactate as an end product, with no release of $CO_2$. (Used by muscles during strenuous exercise).

> [!IMPORTANT] ATP Yield Comparison:
> * **Cellular Respiration:** Produces ~30-32 ATP per glucose molecule.
> * **Fermentation:** Produces only 2 ATP per glucose molecule.
