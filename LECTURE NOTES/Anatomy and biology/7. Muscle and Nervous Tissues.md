## Muscle Tissue Overview

> [!DEFINITION] Muscle Tissue:
> Tissue characterized by properties that allow movement. Muscle cells are **excitable** (respond to stimulus) and **contractile** (shorten to generate pulling force).

**Shared Properties:**
* **Excitability:** Plasma membranes can change electrical states (action potentials).
* **Elasticity:** Can recoil to original length.
* **Extensibility:** Can stretch.
* **Contractility:** Can pull on attachment points and shorten with force.

There are three types of muscle tissue: **Skeletal**, **Cardiac**, and **Smooth**.

## Skeletal Muscle

> [!NOTE] Functions:
> * **Movement:** Locomotion, facial expressions, voluntary control.
> * **Posture:** Resisting gravity to hold body upright.
> * **Stability:** Preventing excess movement of joints.
> * **Thermal Homeostasis:** Generating heat as a byproduct of contraction (e.g., shivering).
> * **Protection:** Acting as an external barrier for internal organs.

**Morphology and Structure:**
* **Appearance:** Striated (due to regular arrangement of actin and myosin) and multinucleated.
* **Organization:** Arranged in bundles surrounded by connective tissue layers (mysia). The **epimysium** wraps the entire muscle.
* **Attachment:** Collagen in tissue layers intertwines with tendons to pull on periosteum of bones.

> [!DEFINITION] Sarcomere:
> The functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber. It is a highly organized arrangement of contractile myofilaments: **Actin** (thin filament) and **Myosin** (thick filament), along with regulatory proteins (**Troponin** and **Tropomyosin**).

**Mechanism of Contraction:**
1.  **Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ):** Motor neuron releases **Acetylcholine (ACh)**.
2.  **Excitation:** Muscle fiber membrane depolarizes; **Calcium ions ($\text{Ca}^{++}$)** are released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR).
3.  **Cross-Bridge Cycle:** $\text{Ca}^{++}$ binds to troponin, moving tropomyosin to expose binding sites on actin. Myosin heads bind to actin and pull (power stroke), powered by **ATP**.

**Energy Sources for Contraction:**
* **Creatine Phosphate:** fast regeneration of ATP (approx. 15 seconds).
* **Anaerobic Glycolysis:** Breakdown of glucose without oxygen (produces lactic acid, powers short bursts).
* **Aerobic Respiration:** Breakdown of glucose/fatty acids with oxygen in mitochondria (efficient, sustainable, produces ~36 ATP).

## Cardiac and Smooth Muscle

| Feature | Cardiac Muscle | Smooth Muscle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Heart walls | Internal organs, airways, arteries |
| **Appearance** | Striated, branching fibers | Non-striated, spindle-shaped |
| **Nucleus** | Single, central | Single |
| **Control** | Involuntary, intrinsic rhythm | Involuntary |
| **Key Structures** | **Intercalated discs** (junctions allowing synchronization) | Non-regular protein arrangement |

## Nervous Tissue

> [!NOTE] Function:
> Characterized by being excitable and capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals to provide the body with information.

It consists of two main cell classes:
1.  **Neurons:** Propagate information via action potentials.
2.  **Neuroglia (Glial cells):** Support neurons and modulate information.

### Neurons
Neurons display a distinctive morphology:
* **Cell Body (Soma):** Contains nucleus and organelles.
* **Dendrites:** Thin extensions that receive signals.
* **Axon:** Long tail that transmits signals (often wrapped in **myelin**).
* **Synapse:** Gap between nerve cells or targets where impulses are transmitted chemically.

**Neuron Types:**
* **Multipolar:** Several dendrites, one axon.
* **Bipolar:** Single dendrite, one axon.
* **Unipolar:** Single process dividing into functional dendrite and axon.

### Neuroglia
* **Astrocytes (CNS):** Regulate ion concentration, uptake neurotransmitters, form the **Blood-Brain Barrier**.
* **Microglia:** Protect against infection (related to macrophages).
* **Oligodendrocytes (CNS) / Schwann Cells (PNS):** Produce **myelin** insulation.

## Neurophysiology: Action Potentials

> [!DEFINITION] Resting Membrane Potential:
> The voltage difference across the membrane of a resting neuron, determined by concentration gradients of ions.
> * High $\text{K}^+$ inside, High $\text{Na}^+$ outside.
> * Maintained by leakage channels and the $\text{Na}^+/\text{K}^+$ pump.

**Action Potential Phases:**
1.  **Resting State:** Voltage-gated channels closed.
2.  **Depolarization:** Stimulus causes voltage-gated $\text{Na}^+$ channels to open; $\text{Na}^+$ rushes in, making the inside positive.
3.  **Repolarization/Hyperpolarization:** $\text{K}^+$ channels open, $\text{K}^+$ rushes out, restoring negative charge.

## Synaptic Transmission

> [!IMPORTANT] The Synapse:
> The point of communication between two neurons or a neuron and a target.

**Mechanism:**
1.  Action potential arrives at the axon terminal.
2.  Voltage-gated **$\text{Ca}^{++}$ channels** open; $\text{Ca}^{++}$ enters.
3.  Synaptic vesicles fuse with the membrane, releasing **neurotransmitters** into the synaptic cleft.
4.  Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, opening ion channels.

**Postsynaptic Potentials:**
* **EPSP (Excitatory):** Depolarizing (e.g., $\text{Na}^+$ enters); makes target *more* likely to fire.
* **IPSP (Inhibitory):** Hyperpolarizing; makes target *less* likely to fire.

**Signal Termination:**
Neurotransmitters are cleared from the cleft by enzymatic breakdown, reuptake into the presynaptic neuron, or diffusion.
