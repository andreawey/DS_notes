## Anatomy and Physiology Defined

> [!DEFINITION] Anatomy:
> The study of the **structure** of the body and the physical relationships between its constituent parts. It comes from the Greek *anatome* ("dissection").

> [!DEFINITION] Physiology:
> The study of the **function** of body systems and how they work.

> [!NOTE] Relationship:
> Anatomy and physiology are inseparable; structure determines function.

## Levels of Structural Organization

The body is organized in a hierarchy from smallest to largest:
1.  **Chemical Level:** Atoms combine to form molecules.
2.  **Cellular Level:** Molecules combine to form cells, the basic unit of life.
3.  **Tissue Level:** Groups of similar cells working together (Epithelial, Connective, Muscle, Nervous).
4.  **Organ Level:** Structures composed of two or more tissue types performing specific functions.
5.  **Organ System Level:** Organs working together for a common purpose.
6.  **Organismal Level:** The highest level; the sum of all structural levels working together to maintain life.

## Organ Systems Overview

| System | Major Organs | Key Functions |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Integumentary** | Skin, hair, nails | External body covering; protects deeper tissue; synthesizes Vitamin D; houses cutaneous receptors. |
| **Skeletal** | Bones, joints | Protects and supports body organs; provides framework for muscle attachment; forms blood cells; stores minerals. |
| **Muscular** | Skeletal muscles | Allows manipulation of environment, locomotion, and facial expression; maintains posture; produces heat. |
| **Nervous** | Brain, spinal cord, nerves | Fast-acting control system; responds to internal and external changes by activating muscles and glands. |
| **Endocrine** | Glands (thyroid, pituitary, etc.) | Secretes hormones that regulate processes like growth, reproduction, and nutrient use (metabolism). |
| **Cardiovascular** | Heart, blood vessels | Transport system; heart pumps blood; blood carries oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and wastes. |
| **Lymphatic/Immune** | Spleen, lymph nodes | Picks up leaked fluid (lymph) and returns it to blood; disposes of debris; houses white blood cells involved in immunity. |
| **Respiratory** | Lungs, trachea | Keeps blood supplied with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide; gaseous exchange occurs through air sac walls. |
| **Digestive** | Stomach, intestines, liver | Breaks down food into absorbable units; eliminates indigestible foodstuffs as feces. |
| **Urinary** | Kidneys, bladder | Eliminates nitrogenous wastes; regulates water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance of the blood. |
| **Reproductive** | Testes, ovaries | Production of offspring; production of sex hormones and gametes. |

## Necessary Life Functions

> [!IMPORTANT] Maintenance of Life:
> Organisms must perform specific functions to maintain life:
> * **Maintaining Boundaries:** Internal environment remains distinct from external (e.g., cell membranes, skin).
> * **Movement:** Locomotion, propulsion (peristalsis), and contractility.
> * **Responsiveness (Irritability):** Ability to sense changes (stimuli) and react.
> * **Digestion:** Breakdown of ingested foodstuffs to simple molecules.
> * **Metabolism:** All chemical reactions that occur within body cells (catabolism + anabolism).
> * **Excretion:** Removal of wastes from metabolism and digestion.
> * **Reproduction:** Cellular division for growth/repair; production of offspring.
> * **Growth:** Increase in size of a body part or the organism.

## Survival Needs

To survive, the body needs specific factors in appropriate amounts:
* **Nutrients:** Chemicals for energy and cell building (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals).
* **Oxygen:** Required for chemical reactions that release energy from foods.
* **Water:** Provides the fluid base for body secretions and excretions; essential for metabolic reactions.
* **Normal Body Temperature:** Necessary for chemical reactions to proceed at life-sustaining rates ($37^\circ\text{C}$).
* **Atmospheric Pressure:** Required for proper breathing and gas exchange.

## Homeostasis

> [!DEFINITION] Homeostasis:
> The body's ability to maintain relatively stable internal conditions despite continuous changes in the outside world. It indicates a dynamic state of equilibrium.

**Homeostatic Control Mechanisms:**
Communication within the body is essential for homeostasis, primarily accomplished by the nervous and endocrine systems.

**Components of a Control Mechanism:**
1.  **Receptor:** Sensor that monitors the environment and responds to stimuli (changes).
2.  **Control Center:** Determines the set point; analyzes the input signal and determines the appropriate response.
3.  **Effector:** Provides the means for the control center's response (output).

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
* **Negative Feedback:** The output shuts off the original effect of the stimulus or reduces its intensity (e.g., regulation of body temperature, blood glucose). Most homeostatic control mechanisms are negative feedback.
* **Positive Feedback:** The result or response enhances the original stimulus so that the response is accelerated (e.g., blood clotting, labor contractions).

> [!WARNING] Homeostatic Imbalance:
> Disturbance of homeostasis increases the risk of disease and contributes to the changes associated with aging.

## Anatomical Language

> [!NOTE] Anatomical Position:
> Body erect, feet slightly apart, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing away from the body. This is the standard reference point.

**Directional Terms:**
* **Superior (Cranial):** Toward the head/upper part.
* **Inferior (Caudal):** Away from the head/lower part.
* **Anterior (Ventral):** Toward the front.
* **Posterior (Dorsal):** Toward the back.
* **Medial:** Toward the midline.
* **Lateral:** Away from the midline.
* **Intermediate:** Between a more medial and a more lateral structure.
* **Proximal:** Closer to the origin of the body part.
* **Distal:** Farther from the origin of the body part.
* **Superficial (External):** Toward the body surface.
* **Deep (Internal):** Away from the body surface.

**Body Planes:**
* **Sagittal:** Divides the body into right and left parts. (Midsagittal = equal halves).
* **Frontal (Coronal):** Divides the body into anterior and posterior parts.
* **Transverse (Horizontal):** Divides the body into superior and inferior parts (cross-section).

**Body Cavities:**
* **Dorsal Cavity:** Protects nervous system organs.
    * *Cranial Cavity:* Encases the brain.
    * *Vertebral Cavity:* Encases the spinal cord.
* **Ventral Cavity:** Houses internal organs (viscera).
    * *Thoracic Cavity:* Contains heart and lungs.
    * *Abdominopelvic Cavity:* Separated from the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm; contains digestive viscera (abdominal) and bladder/reproductive organs (pelvic).
