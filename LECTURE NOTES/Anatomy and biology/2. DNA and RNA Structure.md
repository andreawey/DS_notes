## The Central Dogma

> [!DEFINITION] Gene Expression:
> The process of going from $\text{DNA}$ to a functional product. Genes may specify polypeptides (proteins/protein subunits) or functional $\text{RNA}$s (such as $\text{tRNA}$s and $\text{rRNA}$s).

> [!IMPORTANT] The Central Dogma:
> Information flows directionally from $\text{DNA} \to \text{RNA} \to \text{protein}$. This process involves two main steps:
> 1.  **Transcription:** $\text{DNA}$ sequence is copied to make an $\text{RNA}$ molecule.
> 2.  **Translation:** The $\text{mRNA}$ sequence is decoded to specify the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide.

## Nucleic Acid Structure: Nucleotides

> [!DEFINITION] Nucleotides and Polynucleotides:
> $\text{DNA}$ and $\text{RNA}$ are polymers made up of monomers called **nucleotides**. Multiple monomers combined form a **polynucleotide**.

> [!NOTE] Nucleotide Components:
> Each nucleotide is composed of:
> * A nitrogen-containing ring structure called a **nitrogenous base**.
> * A **five-carbon sugar**.
> * At least one **phosphate group**.

> [!TIP] Bases (Purines vs. Pyrimidines):
> The nitrogenous bases are classified by structure:
> * **Purines:** Two fused carbon-nitrogen rings (Adenine, Guanine).
> * **Pyrimidines:** Single carbon-nitrogen ring (Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil).

## DNA Structure and Properties

> [!NOTE] DNA Structure (Deoxyribonucleic acid):
> * $\text{DNA}$ is a **double helix**, consisting of two matching chains stuck together.
> * The **sugar-phosphate backbone** lies on the outside of the helix.
> * The nitrogenous bases extend into the interior, pairing up via **hydrogen bonds**.

> [!IMPORTANT] Antiparallel Orientation:
> The two strands of the helix run in **opposite directions (antiparallel)**, meaning the $5^{\prime}$ end of one strand is paired with the $3^{\prime}$ end of its matching strand.

> [!IMPORTANT] Base Pairing Rules:
> Base pairing is highly specific:
> * **Adenine (A)** pairs only with **Thymine (T)** (in $\text{DNA}$).
> * **Guanine (G)** pairs only with **Cytosine (C)**.
> When two sequences match in this way, they are said to be **complementary**.

> [!NOTE] DNA Localization:
> * **Eukaryotes** have a well-defined **nucleus** containing the $\text{DNA}$ (chromatin).
> * **Prokaryotes** (bacteria) have their chromosome lying in the cytoplasm in an area called the **nucleoid**. 

## RNA Structure and Types

> [!NOTE] RNA Structure and Differences from DNA:
> $\text{RNA}$ (Ribonucleic acid) is usually **single-stranded**. $\text{RNA}$ nucleotides contain:
> * **Ribose** (five-carbon sugar), which has an $-\text{OH}$ group missing in deoxyribose.
> * One of four bases: **Adenine (A), Uracil (U), Guanine (G), or Cytosine (C)**.
> * $\text{RNA}$ uses **Uracil (U)** instead of the Thymine (T) found in $\text{DNA}$.

> [!EXAMPLE] Types of RNA:
> * **Messenger $\text{RNA}$ ($\text{mRNA}$):** Carries genetic information for protein synthesis.
> * **Ribosomal $\text{RNA}$ ($\text{rRNA}$):** A major component of ribosomes; some $\text{rRNA}$s act as enzymes (**ribozymes**).
> * **Transfer $\text{RNA}$ ($\text{tRNA}$):** Acts as a carrier to bring specific amino acids to the ribosome.
> * **Regulatory $\text{RNA}$s ($\text{miRNA}$s and $\text{siRNA}$s):** Small $\text{RNA}$s that regulate gene expression by reducing $\text{mRNA}$ stability or interfering with translation.

## Transcription: DNA to RNA

> [!DEFINITION] Transcription Goal:
> To make an $\text{RNA}$ copy (primary transcript) of a gene’s $\text{DNA}$ sequence, carrying the information needed to build a polypeptide.

> [!IMPORTANT] Transcription Mechanism:
> **$\text{RNA}$ polymerases** use one strand of $\text{DNA}$ (the **template strand**) as a template to synthesize a complementary $\text{RNA}$ strand in the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction.

> [!NOTE] Stages of Transcription:
> 1.  **Initiation:** $\text{RNA}$ polymerase binds to the **promoter** region.
> 2.  **Elongation:** $\text{RNA}$ polymerase "walks" along the $\text{DNA}$ template strand, adding complementary $\text{RNA}$ nucleotides.
> 3.  **Termination:** $\text{RNA}$ polymerase stops transcribing when it reaches a **terminator** sequence.

> [!EXAMPLE] Promoter Elements:
> * **Bacteria:** Promoters contain **$-10$ and $-35$ elements** that position the $\text{RNA}$ polymerase.
> * **Eukaryotes:** **Basal transcription factors** bind first, recognizing sequences like the **$\text{TATA}$ box**.

## Eukarya pre-mRNA Processing

> [!IMPORTANT] Eukaryotic vs. Prokaryotic Transcription:
> * In **bacteria**, $\text{RNA}$ transcripts are ready for translation immediately (forming a **polyribosome**).
> * In **eukaryotes**, the initial $\text{RNA}$ transcript is a **pre-mRNA** and must be processed into mature $\text{mRNA}$ in the nucleus before translation. 

> [!NOTE] pre-mRNA Modifications:
> * **$5^{\prime}$ cap:** Modified guanine added to the $5^{\prime}$ end; protects the transcript and helps the ribosome attach.
> * **Poly-A tail:** $\text{A}$ nucleotides added to the $3^{\prime}$ end; makes the transcript more stable and aids export.

> [!DEFINITION] RNA Splicing:
> The removal of non-coding sequences (**introns**) and the pasting together of coding sequences (**exons**) by the **spliceosome** to form mature $\text{mRNA}$.

> [!HINT] Alternative Splicing:
> The same pre-mRNA can be spliced in different ways, resulting in multiple mature $\text{mRNA}$ molecules that translate into proteins with different structures.

## Translation and the Genetic Code

> [!DEFINITION] Translation:
> The process of using the nucleotide sequence in an $\text{mRNA}$ to build the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide inside a **ribosome**.

> [!DEFINITION] Codons and the Genetic Code:
> * $\text{mRNA}$ is read in triplets called **codons**.
> * **Genetic Code:** The relationship between codons and amino acids.
> * **Start Codon (AUG):** Specifies methionine and signals the start of translation.
> * **Stop Codons (UAA, UAG, UGA):** Signal the end of the polypeptide.

> [!NOTE] Translation Requirements:
> * **Ribosomes:** Provide structure and catalyze peptide bond formation. The ribosome is about two-thirds $\text{rRNA}$ and one-third protein.
> * **$\text{tRNA}$s (Transfer $\text{RNA}$s):** Adapter molecules that carry amino acids and match them to the $\text{mRNA}$ codons.

> [!NOTE] Stages of Translation:
> 1.  **Initiation:** Ribosome, $\text{mRNA}$, and the first $\text{tRNA}$ come together.
>     * **Eukaryotes:** Ribosome scans from the $5^{\prime}$ $\text{GTP}$ cap for $\text{AUG}$.
>     * **Bacteria:** Ribosome attaches directly to **Shine-Dalgarno sequences** near the $\text{AUG}$ codon.
> 2.  **Elongation:** $\text{tRNA}$s move through the $\text{A}$, $\text{P}$, and $\text{E}$ sites, linking amino acids together. The polypeptide grows from the **$\text{N}$-terminus** (amino group) to the **$\text{C}$-terminus** (carboxyl group).
> 3.  **Termination:** Occurs when a stop codon enters the $\text{A}$ site, triggering release factors to free the finished polypeptide.
