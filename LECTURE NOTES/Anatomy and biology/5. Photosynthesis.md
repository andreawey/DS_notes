## Photosynthesis Overview

> [!DEFINITION] Photosynthesis:
> The process that converts solar energy into chemical energy within chloroplasts. It nourishes almost the entire living world directly or indirectly.

* **Autotrophs:** "Self-feeders" that sustain themselves without eating anything derived from other organisms. They are the producers of the biosphere (e.g., plants, algae, some prokaryotes).
* **Heterotrophs:** Obtain organic material from other organisms. They are the consumers of the biosphere (e.g., humans, animals).

### The Chemical Process
Photosynthesis is a redox process where $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is oxidized and $\text{CO}_2$ is reduced.

**Equation:** $6\text{CO}_2 + 12\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Light energy} \to \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}$

## Chloroplasts: The Sites of Photosynthesis

> [!NOTE] Location:
> Chloroplasts are found mainly in cells of the **mesophyll**, the interior tissue of the leaf. Each mesophyll cell contains 30–40 chloroplasts.

* **Stomata:** Microscopic pores where $\text{CO}_2$ enters and $\text{O}_2$ exits the leaf.
* **Stroma:** A dense fluid surrounded by an envelope of two membranes.
* **Thylakoids:** Connected sacs in the chloroplast that compose a third membrane system. They may be stacked in columns called **grana**.
* **Chlorophyll:** The pigment that gives leaves their green color, located in the thylakoid membranes.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis consists of two processes:
1.  **Light Reactions** (the *photo* part).
2.  **Calvin Cycle** (the *synthesis* part).

### 1. The Light Reactions

> [!IMPORTANT] Function:
> Convert solar energy to the chemical energy of $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$. Occur in the **thylakoids**.

* **Key Steps:**
    * Split $\text{H}_2\text{O}$.
    * Release $\text{O}_2$.
    * Reduce the electron acceptor $\text{NADP}^+$ to $\text{NADPH}$.
    * Generate $\text{ATP}$ from $\text{ADP}$ by photophosphorylation.

**Light and Pigments:**
* Light is a form of electromagnetic energy traveling in rhythmic waves. It behaves as discrete particles called **photons**.
* **Pigments** represent substances that absorb visible light.
    * **Chlorophyll $a$:** The main photosynthetic pigment.
    * **Chlorophyll $b$:** An accessory pigment that broadens the spectrum used for photosynthesis.
    * **Carotenoids:** Accessory pigments that absorb excessive light that would damage chlorophyll.

**Photosystems:**
A photosystem consists of a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes.
* **Photosystem II ($\text{PS II}$):** Functions first. Its reaction-center chlorophyll $a$ is called $\text{P680}$.
* **Photosystem I ($\text{PS I}$):** Functions second. Its reaction-center chlorophyll $a$ is called $\text{P700}$.

> [!NOTE] Linear Electron Flow:
> The primary pathway involving both photosystems. It produces $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$ using light energy.

### 2. The Calvin Cycle

> [!DEFINITION] The Calvin Cycle:
> A cycle occurring in the **stroma** that builds sugar from smaller molecules by using $\text{ATP}$ and the reducing power of electrons carried by $\text{NADPH}$.

The cycle builds sugar ($\text{G3P}$) from $\text{CO}_2$. For net synthesis of 1 $\text{G3P}$, the cycle must take place three times, fixing 3 molecules of $\text{CO}_2$.

**Three Phases:**
1.  **Carbon fixation:** Catalyzed by the enzyme **rubisco**.
2.  **Reduction:** Formation of $\text{G3P}$.
3.  **Regeneration of the $\text{CO}_2$ acceptor:** Regeneration of $\text{RuBP}$.

## Alternative Mechanisms of Carbon Fixation

> [!WARNING] Photorespiration:
> In hot, dry days, plants close stomata to conserve water, which limits photosynthesis. The closing of stomata reduces access to $\text{CO}_2$ and causes $\text{O}_2$ buildup. Rubisco adds $\text{O}_2$ instead of $\text{CO}_2$ in the Calvin cycle, consuming $\text{ATP}$ and releasing $\text{CO}_2$ without producing sugar.

Plants have evolved adaptations to minimize photorespiration in hot climates:

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **$\text{C}_3$ Plants** | Initial fixation of $\text{CO}_2$ forms a three-carbon compound (3-phosphoglycerate). Susceptible to photorespiration. | Rice, wheat, soy |
| **$\text{C}_4$ Plants** | Minimize photorespiration by incorporating $\text{CO}_2$ into four-carbon compounds in mesophyll cells. These compounds are exported to bundle-sheath cells, where they release $\text{CO}_2$ for the Calvin cycle. | Sugarcane, corn |
| **CAM Plants** | Open stomata at night to incorporate $\text{CO}_2$ into organic acids (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). Stomata close during the day, and $\text{CO}_2$ is released from organic acids for the Calvin cycle. | Succulents, pineapple |
