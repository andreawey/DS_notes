## Fundamental Chemical Concepts

> [!DEFINITION] Atom:
> The smallest amount of an element.

> [!DEFINITION] Molecule and Compound:
> A **Molecule** consists of two or more atoms chemically joined (e.g., $\text{H}_2$, $\text{O}_2$). A **Compound** is a molecule containing more than one element (e.g., $\text{H}_2\text{O}$).

> [!NOTE] Biomolecules Overview:
> * Biomolecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids, make up $96\%$ of an organism.
> * They are built upon a carbon scaffold, which is essential to life.

> [!DEFINITION] Macromolecule vs. Supramolecule:
> * **Macromolecules** are covalently bonded monomers (e.g., starch, ssRNA).
> * **Supramolecules** are large structures that are *not* necessarily covalently bonded (e.g., DNA, protein platform). Hemoglobin is a supramolecule made of 4 globin proteins connected by hydrogen bonds.

## Water and Carbon: Essential for Life

### Water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$)

> [!IMPORTANT] Water's Polarity:
> The $104.5^{\circ}$ angle in the water molecule results in the oxygen atom being negative and the hydrogen atoms being relatively positive. This creates **polarity** and **hydrophilicity**.

> [!TIP] Life-Supporting Property of Ice:
> Solid ice has a **lower density than liquid water** (it floats). This property is crucial as it insulates the water below, preventing entire bodies of water from freezing solid and protecting aquatic life.

### Carbon and Functional Groups

> [!IMPORTANT] Uniqueness of Carbon:
> Carbon is unique because it has a valence of 4 and readily forms **covalent bonds with other carbon atoms**, making **long chains** possible.

| Functional Group | Formula | Found In |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hydroxyl** | -OH | carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids |
| **Carbonyl** | $\text{C}=\text{O}$ | carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids |
| **Carboxyl** | $-\text{COOH}$ | proteins, lipids |
| **Amino** | $-\text{NH}_2$ | proteins, nucleic acids |
| **Phosphate** | $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ | nucleic acids |
| **Sulfhydryl** | $-\text{S}-\text{H}$ | proteins |

## Biomolecule Structure and Stereochemistry

> [!NOTE] Structure and Function:
> * The specific **3D shape** of a biomolecule is necessary for its proper function.
> * This shape is maintained by flexible **non-covalent bonds**.

> [!DEFINITION] Isomers and Stereochemistry:
> * **Isomers** have the same molecular formula but different structures.
> * **Stereochemistry** involves a chiral carbon bonded to four different groups, creating non-superimposable mirror images called **enantiomers (optical isomers)**.
> * **Biological systems usually use only one specific isomer** of a given compound.

## Carbohydrates (Saccharides)

> [!NOTE] Carbohydrate Functions:
> Serve as a primary **energy source** (e.g., glucose), have a **structural function** (e.g., cellulose), and are involved in **molecular modification/signaling** (e.g., glycoproteins).

> [!DEFINITION] Monosaccharides:
> Simple sugars (3-7 C). Classified as **aldoses** (carbonyl $\text{C}$ is terminal, or aldehyde group) or **ketoses** (carbonyl $\text{C}$ is internal, or ketone group).
> * **Glucose** is the most abundant monosaccharide and main energy source.
> * Over $99\%$ of glucose is typically found in the circular (ring) form in solution.

| Polysaccharide | Monomer | Type of Bond | Function |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Starch** | $\alpha$-glucose | $\alpha-1,4$ and $\alpha-1,6$ glycosidic bonds | Energy storage (plants) |
| **Glycogen** | $\alpha$-glucose | $\alpha-1,4$ and $\alpha-1,6$ glycosidic bonds | Energy storage (animals) |
| **Cellulose** | $\beta$-glucose | $\beta-1,4$ glycosidic bonds | Structural (plant cell wall) |

> [!IMPORTANT] Glycogen Regulation:
> * **Insulin** (anabolic hormone) promotes glucose uptake $\to$ hypoglycaemic activity.
> * **Glucagon** (catabolic hormone) induces glycogen lysis $\to$ glucose production.

> [!EXAMPLE] Modified Carbohydrates:
> * **Amino sugars** (e.g., $\text{NAGal}$): A hydroxyl group is replaced with an amine group.
> * **Chitins:** Structural polysaccharides providing high strength (fungi cell walls, arthropod exoskeletons).
> * **Glycoproteins:** Proteins covalently linked to oligosaccharides, involved in cell adhesion, recognition, and immune function.

## Lipids

> [!NOTE] Lipid Characteristics and Functions:
> Lipids are a heterogeneous group (fats, oils, waxes) that are typically **apolar and hydrophobic**.
> * **Structural:** Form cell membranes (phospholipids).
> * **Energy Storage:** Neutral fats provide long-term energy storage.
> * **Signaling:** Hormones and prostaglandins.
> * **Protection:** Mechanical, thermal, and photoprotection.

> [!WARNING] Saturated vs. Unsaturated Fats:
> * **Saturated fats** (max $\text{H}$ atoms) are usually solid at room temperature ($\text{RT}$).
> * **Unsaturated fats** (contain double bonds) are usually liquid at $\text{RT}$ and can create kinks in the chain.

> [!HINT] Phospholipids and Cholesterol:
> * **Phospholipids** are amphipathic, forming the lipid bilayer membrane structure.
> * **Cholesterol** acts as a bidirectional regulator of membrane fluidity, stabilizing it at high temperatures and preventing stiffening at low temperatures.

## Amino Acids and Proteins

> [!DEFINITION] Amino Acids (AA):
> Building blocks of proteins; organic compounds with a backbone ($\text{CH} + \text{amine} + \text{carboxylic acid}$) and a specific $\text{R}$ side-chain. They function as a **biological buffer**.

> [!IMPORTANT] Essential AA:
> **Essential AA** must be supplied in the diet. Unlike lipids and carbohydrates, there is **no storage of excess AA**; deficiency leads to protein degradation (e.g., muscle).

> [!NOTE] Hierarchical Protein Structure:
> 1.  **Primary:** Sequence of residues.
> 2.  **Secondary:** Local regular 3-D structure (e.g., $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands) formed by **hydrogen bonds** between backbone atoms.
> 3.  **Tertiary:** Global 3-D shape determined by $\text{R}$ group interactions.
> 4.  **Quaternary:** Spatial organization of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits).

> [!EXAMPLE] Protein Function Classification:
> 
| Functional Class | Examples & Function |
|:---|:---|
| **Structural** | **Actin** (cytoskeleton, cell motility), **Tubulin** (microtubules, transport), **Collagen** (connective tissue), **Elastin** (arteries, lungs). |
| **Motoric** | **Myosin** (converts ATP to mechanical energy for contraction and movement). |
| **Enzyme** | **Enzymes (E)**: Biological catalysis; accelerate reactions by **reducing the activation energy barrier**. |
| **Immunologic** | **Antibodies ($\text{Ig}$)**: Identify and neutralize pathogens. |
| **Transport** | **Pores/Channels** (facilitated diffusion). **Carriers** (facilitated or active transport, e.g., $\text{NA}^+/\text{K}^+$ pump using $\text{ATP}$). |
> [!NOTE] Phospholipids (Water Barriers):
> * **Phospholipids** (1 glycerol + 2 fatty acids + 1 phosphate group modified by an alcohol + $\text{R}$) are mainly involved in **cell membrane creation** (fluid mosaic) and signaling.
> * They are **amphipatic**, allowing formation of lipid bilayer, micelles and liposomes.
> * Biological membranes remain fluid because of the **unsaturated tails**.
> * **Cholesterol** acts as a bidirectional regulator of membrane fluidity, stabilizing it at high temperatures and preventing stiffening at low temperatures.



## Amino Acids and Proteins

> [!DEFINITION] Amino Acids (AA):
> Organic compounds containing a backbone ($\text{CH}$ + amine $-\text{NH}_2$ + carboxylic acid $-\text{COOH}$) along with a side-chain ($\text{R}$ group), specific to each $\text{AA}$, which confers physicochemical peculiarities.
> * They play central roles both as **building blocks of proteins** and as **intermediates in metabolism**.
> * They can be considered a **biological buffer** in solution.
> * All amino acids except glycine are **chiral**.

> [!NOTE] Essential and Non-Essential AA:
> * **Essential aa:** must be supplied in the food. Failure in obtaining them leads to protein degradation (e.g., muscle) because there is **no storage of $\text{AA}$ excess** (unlike lipids and carbohydrates).
> * **Non-essential aa:** can be synthesized within the body or derived from essential amino acids.

> [!DEFINITION] Protein Synthesis:
> The $\text{AA}$ content and sequence are determined by the gene sequence. $\text{DNA}$ is transcribed into $\text{mRNA}$, which is then translated into the $\text{AA}$ sequence through ribosomes ($\text{RER}$).

> [!NOTE] Hierarchical Protein Structure:
> 1.  **Primary structure:** sequence of residues in the polypeptide chain.
> 2.  **Secondary structure:** local regular 3-D structure mainly formed through **hydrogen bonds** between backbone atoms, typically found at the core.
>     * **$\alpha$-helices** (more elastic).
>     * **$\beta$-strands** (form $\beta$-sheets).
> 3.  **Tertiary structure:** **global atomic positions in 3-D space**; determined by interaction of $\text{R}$ groups.

> [!NOTE] Protein Function Examples:
> 
| Functional Class | Examples & Function |
|:---|:---|
| **Structural** | **Intracellular:** **Actin** (in all euk. microfilaments, component of the cytoskeleton, contractile apparatus, signal transduction, cell motility). **Tubulin** (major building block of microtubules, functions as structural and mobile elements in mitosis, transport, flagellar movement). **Extracellular:** **Collagen** (most abundant mammalian protein, main component of connective tissues). **Elastin** (major component of tissues that require elasticity, such as arteries, lungs, skin). **Keratins** ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) (e.g. hair, quill, scale). |
| **Motoric** | **Myosin** is the molecular motor that converts chemical energy in $\text{ATP}$ to mechanical energy, generating force and movement (e.g., muscle contraction, cell division). **Actin filaments** act as a structural scaffold in association with myosin. |
| **Enzyme** | **Enzyme (E)**: biological catalysis; accelerates chemical reactions (thousands of times or more) by **reducing activation energy barrier**. Most are proteins, but a few are catalytic $\text{RNA}$ molecules. $\text{E}$'s specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures. |
| **Immunologic** | **Antibodies (Immunoglobulin, $\text{Ig}$)**: $\text{Y}$-shaped protein used to identify and neutralize pathogens or infected cells. Can be considered **receptors as well as signals**. |
| **Transport** | **Pores and Channel** $\to$ facilitated diffusion. **Carriers** $\to$ facilitated diffusion (following the gradient) or **active transport** (against the gradient, uses $\text{ATP}$ e.g. $\text{NA}^+/\text{K}^+$ pump).  |
