## Introduction to Tissues

> [!DEFINITION] Tissue:
> A group of cells with similar structure and function that work together to perform specific activities. The study of tissues is called **histology**.

There are four primary types of body tissues:
1.  **Epithelial Tissue** (Covering)
2.  **Connective Tissue** (Support)
3.  **Muscle Tissue** (Movement)
4.  **Nervous Tissue** (Control)

## Epithelial Tissue

> [!IMPORTANT] Functions and Locations:
> Epithelium forms the boundaries between different environments.
> * **Locations:** Body coverings, body linings, and glandular tissue.
> * **Functions:** Protection, absorption, filtration, and secretion.

**Characteristics of Epithelium:**
* **Cellularity:** Cells fit closely together to form continuous sheets.
* **Polarity:** Cells have an **apical surface** (free, exposed to exterior or cavity) and a **basal surface** (attached).
* **Attachment:** Supported by a basement membrane (basal lamina + reticular lamina).
* **Avascularity:** Has no blood supply of its own; relies on diffusion.
* **Regeneration:** High capacity to replace lost cells via division.

**Classification:**
Epithelium is named based on the number of cell layers and the shape of the cells.

| Layers | Shape | Description/Function |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Simple** (One layer) | **Squamous** | Flattened/scale-like. Filtration and diffusion (e.g., lungs, capillaries). |
| | **Cuboidal** | Cube-shaped. Secretion and absorption (e.g., kidney tubules, glands). |
| | **Columnar** | Tall/column-like. Absorption and secretion (e.g., digestive tract). Can have microvilli or cilia. |
| **Stratified** (Multiple layers) | **Squamous** | Protection against abrasion (e.g., skin, mouth, esophagus). |
| | **Cuboidal/Columnar** | Rare; found in ducts of large glands. |
| | **Transitional** | Shape changes (stretches). Found in the urinary bladder. |

> [!NOTE] Glandular Epithelium:
> * **Endocrine gland:** Ductless; secretes hormones directly into the blood (e.g., thyroid, pituitary).
> * **Exocrine gland:** Has ducts; secretions empty onto the epithelial surface (e.g., sweat, oil, liver, pancreas).

## Connective Tissue

> [!DEFINITION] Connective Tissue:
> The most abundant and widely distributed tissue type. Its main functions are protection, binding/support, insulation, and transportation.

**Common Characteristics:**
* **Vascularity:** Variations in blood supply (e.g., cartilage is avascular, bone is highly vascular).
* **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):** Non-living material that surrounds living cells, allowing tissue to bear weight and withstand tension. Composed of:
    * **Ground substance:** Unstructured material (water, adhesion proteins, polysaccharides).
    * **Fibers:** Collagen (strength), Elastic (stretch), Reticular (fine skeleton).

**Types of Connective Tissue:**

1.  **Bone (Osseous Tissue):**
    * Hard matrix of calcium salts and collagen fibers.
    * Cells are **osteocytes** in lacunae.
    * Functions: Support and protection.
2.  **Cartilage:**
    * Less hard and more flexible than bone. Cells are **chondrocytes**.
    * **Hyaline:** Most abundant (fetal skeleton, rib ends). Collagen fibers hidden in rubbery matrix.
    * **Elastic:** Provides elasticity (external ear).
    * **Fibrocartilage:** Highly compressible (vertebral discs).
3.  **Dense Connective Tissue:**
    * Main matrix element is collagen fibers. Fibroblasts are the cells.
    * **Dense Regular:** Tendons (muscle to bone) and Ligaments (bone to bone).
    * **Dense Irregular:** Dermis of the skin.
4.  **Loose Connective Tissue:**
    * **Areolar:** "Cobwebby" packing tissue; soaks up excess fluid (edema).
    * **Adipose (Fat):** Insulates, protects, stores fuel. Nucleus pushed to the side by fat droplet.
    * **Reticular:** Forms stroma (internal framework) of lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen).
5.  **Blood (Vascular Tissue):**
    * Blood cells surrounded by a fluid matrix (**plasma**).
    * Fibers are visible only during clotting.
    * Function: Transport vehicle for the cardiovascular system.

## Muscle Tissue

> [!NOTE] Function:
> Highly cellular and well-vascularized tissue responsible for body movement via contraction.

| Muscle Type | Control | Appearance | Nuclei | Location |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Skeletal** | Voluntary | Striated (banded), long, cylindrical | Multinucleate | Attached to skeleton (pulls on bones or skin). |
| **Cardiac** | Involuntary | Striated, branching cells connected by **intercalated discs** | Uninucleate | Found only in the heart. |
| **Smooth** | Involuntary | Non-striated, spindle-shaped | Uninucleate | Walls of hollow organs (stomach, uterus, blood vessels). |

## Nervous Tissue

> [!DEFINITION] Nervous Tissue:
> The main component of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves), responsible for regulating and controlling body functions.

Composed of two major cell types:
1.  **Neurons:** Specialized cells that generate and conduct nerve impulses. Characteristics include **irritability** and **conductivity**.
2.  **Neuroglia (Glial cells):** Supporting cells that insulate, support, and protect neurons. They do not transmit impulses.

## Tissue Repair (Wound Healing)

> [!IMPORTANT] Regeneration vs. Fibrosis:
> * **Regeneration:** Replacement of destroyed tissue by the *same kind* of cells.
> * **Fibrosis:** Repair by dense connective tissue (formation of **scar tissue**).
> The type of repair depends on the type of tissue damaged and the severity of the injury.

**Steps of Tissue Repair:**
1.  **Inflammation:** Capillaries become permeable; clotting proteins migrate to the area; clot walls off the injured area.
2.  **Granulation tissue forms:** Delicate pink tissue containing new capillaries grows into the damaged area.
3.  **Regeneration/Fibrosis:** Surface epithelium regenerates; the scab detaches.

* **Tissues that regenerate easily:** Epithelial tissue, fibrous connective tissue, bone.
* **Tissues that regenerate poorly:** Skeletal muscle.
* **Tissues replaced largely with scar tissue:** Cardiac muscle, nervous tissue (within the brain/spinal cord).
