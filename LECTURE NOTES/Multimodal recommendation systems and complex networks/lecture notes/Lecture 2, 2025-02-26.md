Collaborative filtering -> designed to help users find what they might be interested in among a range of available selections.

3 main categories:
- Models to predict social connections or links between users in social media platforms for example
- Models to predict ratings of a user for an item such as music 
- Models to rank the top-K items for a user when he has only few items rated by himself

main components: 
- stored data
- algorithms
- filtered results


Main idea of CF is that users who had the same interests or preferences in the past are likely to have the same interests in the future.

Main techniques of CF:
 1. neighborhood-based CF (NBCF)
 2. model-based CF: (NBCF)
 3. graph-based CF: (GBCF)
 4. hybrid-based CF: (HBCF)



## *Neighborhood-based*
this technique uses stored item-user ratings to make predictions
it is very slow as each time it has to access stored ratings, perform calculations and make predictions
it can be classified as:
- user-based
- content-based
the components of neighborhood based CF are:
- ratings normalization
	- needed to normalize user bias as some might rate differently than others
	- usually mean-centric or Z-Score
- correlation imputation
	- using usually cosine vectore (CV) or pearson correlation (PC)
- selection process


choosing an appropriate number of neighbors is crucial since we don't want to include everybody's opinion. there are two main steps.
1. Global filtering to keep similar users or items
2. pre-prediction step which only keeps the best candidates

some research says it should be between 20 and 50 but others say that it should be estimated by Cross Validation



### *User Based*
this technique uses previous ratings of users that share the same interest of the target user
it initially finds similar ranking patterns between users, then it measures the similarity and finds neighborhood of a user, and uses the neighbor's ratings to predict users rating

example using weighted average to compute missing rating 
1. calculate pearson correlation between target user and neighbors on shared ratings
2. use this to calculate a prediction for an unrated movie of target


### *Item Based*
uses previous ratings of the same user 
there are two categories:
1. personalized where recomendations are generated differently for each user
2. non personalized where a top 10 style reccomendation for all users is predicted
does the same as user based but on items 

- compute similarity
- itenfiy similar neighborhoods
- then uses neighbor ratings to make predictions




## Model based
solves issues:
- limited coverage
- matrix sparsity

two main categories:
1. factorization technique
2. adaptive neighborhood learning technique

### *Factorization technique*

factorizing a matrix to combat matrix sparsity projecting it into a lower space with techniques such as SVD or PCA
this also mitigates problems of cold start where not many ratings are given 

### *Adaptive neighborhood*

## Graph based

## Hybrid based
combination of techniques also using voting
