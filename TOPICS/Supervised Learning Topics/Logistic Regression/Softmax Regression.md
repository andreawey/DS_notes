Generalization of the [[Logistic Regression]] model to support multiple classes
When given an instance of x, the softmax regression model
- computes a score for each class k
- estimates the probability that the instance x belongs to each of the classes k by applying the softmax function to the score
The softmax regression classifier predicts the class with the highest estimated probability
