When you have [[Missing Data|Missing Data]] you can:


Eliminate the data
- eliminate the object: eliminate the row if missing data is higher than a certain threshold (ex: 70%)
- eliminate the feature: eliminate the entire column if the missing data is higher than a certain threshold (ex: 70%)

We might lose the data point with valuable info
