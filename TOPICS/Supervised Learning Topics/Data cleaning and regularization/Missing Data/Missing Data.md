	- ex: technical issues 
	- information not collected (not mandatory)
- Missing at random: Other variables can help deduct the cause
	- Information about the tax declaration is present therefore people do not insert the same info for salary
- Not missing at random: the variable is the reason of the missing value
	- ex: salary is empty for people with very large income
	- ex: attribute may not be applicable (income for children)
