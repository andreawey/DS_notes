<h1>Outlier detection with standard deviation</h1>
if a value has a distance to the average higher than k\*std it can be assumed as an outlier

- [[Z-score]] might be used instead standardizes the distance between a value 
- [[Outliers]] detection with percentiles assumes a certain percent of values from top or bottom of the values are outlier

Outliers can be dropped by deleting the entire row
Outliers can be cropped, keep the data size that can make the model performance better but can affect the distribution.
