It is another regularized version of [[Linear regression]]
-> it adds a regularization term to the cost function, but uses the $l_1$ norm of the weight vector

- As for Ridge, also lasso tends to restrict coefficients to be close to zero
- Lasso tends to completely eliminate the weights of the least important features
- Lasso automatically performs feature selection and outputs a sparse model
