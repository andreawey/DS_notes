A linear model makes a prediction by computing a weighted sum of the input features (x) plus a constant called the bias term or intercept term 

Training a model means setting its parameters so that the model best fits the training set

For this purpose we need a measure of how well the model fits the training data

The most common performance measure of a regression model is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

[[Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)]]

To train a linear regression model we need to find the value of $\theta$ that minimizes the RMSE

In practice it is simpler to minimize the MSE reaching the same result
