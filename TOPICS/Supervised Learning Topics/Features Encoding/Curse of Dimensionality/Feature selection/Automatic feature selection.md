Another type of [[Feature selection]] is Automatic feature selection:

If a model uses fewer features:
- It is easier to interpret 
- it will generalize better (less risk of overfitting)
- it will be faster (more efficient)

Feature engineering can be classified into two use cases:
- Modelling for prediction accuracy 
	- Default, if the goal is to have a productive system
- Modelling for explanations
	- When the model should be easy to interpret
