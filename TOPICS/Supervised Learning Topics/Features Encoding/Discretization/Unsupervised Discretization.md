Another type of [[Discretization]] is Unsupervised discretization

Discretization without using class labels
there are two types of unsupervised discretization

- Equal width discretization 
	- We are interested in the number of bins
	- each bin represents an interval of equal width
	- the values interval is divided in K bins of equal length
	- values range is divided into equally spaced bins and we record for each data point which bin it falls into
- Equal frequency discretization
	- We are interested in how to fill the bins
	- each bin contains the same number of elements 
	- data is sorted and bins are identified
