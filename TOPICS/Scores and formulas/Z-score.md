### Formula
$$
Z = \frac{x-Â \mu} \sigma
$$
*Z* = standard score
*x* = observed value
$\mu$ = mean of the sample
$\sigma$ = standard deviation of the sample

### Use

Standard score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score is above or below the mean of what is being observed or measured
Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores.
