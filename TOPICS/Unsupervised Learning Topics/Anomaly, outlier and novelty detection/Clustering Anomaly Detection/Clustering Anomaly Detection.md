[[Anomaly, outlier and novelty detection]]

Cluster the normal training data points, for example using [[K-Means]] or [[GMM]]. To test whether a new sample is normal or anomalous we check if it can be considered as part of a cluster. 
We are making the strong concentration assumption that normal data can be represented by compact clusters.
