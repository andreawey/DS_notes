Normality and Anomalous Regions

One assumes that the normality region is bounded (has a finite, ideally small, $D$-dimensional volume). The same cannot be said in general for the anomalous region, which is a problem since we cannot assume anomalies are uniformly distributed. Some methods use other assumptions, like the **manifold assumption**.
