[[Reconstruction Anomaly Detection]]

Formally, the encoder-decoder model could learn the identity map (just like the one-class classifier could learn to recognize all data as normal). This means that some kind of regularization is necessary. In contrast to the one-class classifier, many reconstruction setups are implicitly regularized, particularly by a sufficiently small hidden space.
