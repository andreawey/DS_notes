Anomaly Detection (AD) algorithms aim at distinguishing “anomalous” data points from “normal” data points. AD is a fundamental task of [[Unsupervised Learning]], since there are usually no examples (or occasionally very few examples) for anomalous data points.

# Classical Definitions

- **Point anomaly**: a single anomalous data point.
- **Contextual anomaly**: a data point is anomalous in a specific context (i.e., outlier in a time series).
- **Group anomalies**: a set of anomalous points.

We consider only point anomalies.

One can also distinguish **high-level (semantic)** and **low-level (sensory)** anomalies.
