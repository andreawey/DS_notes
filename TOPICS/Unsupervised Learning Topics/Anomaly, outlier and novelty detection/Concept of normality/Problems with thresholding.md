Challenges in Defining Anomalies

1. It may not be obvious how to choose $\tau$. This is a general problem in all AD algorithms, since “anomaly” is not a binary property.
2. It may also be difficult to properly estimate the distribution $P_+(x)$.
3. Even if that is possible, estimating $P_+(x)$ may not be the most efficient way to estimate the set $A$.
