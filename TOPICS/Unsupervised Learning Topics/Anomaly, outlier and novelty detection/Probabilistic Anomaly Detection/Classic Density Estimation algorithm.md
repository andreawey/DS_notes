 [[Probabilistic Anomaly Detection ]]Steps

1. Fit a probability distribution to the “normal” training data. Let $p$ be the density of this distribution.
2. For each test sample $x$, estimate its anomalousness by computing $r := \frac{1}{p(x)}$, or similar.
3. For each test sample $x$, estimate its anomalousness by computing $r := \frac{1}{p(x)}$, or similar.
