Advanced method of soft, [[Flat Clustering]]. Idea: Model clusters statistically, as probability distributions.

• Powerful way to describe clusters of different sizes and shapes
• Prone to overfitting: the model learns the structure of the noise instead of the structure of the underlying data.
• Need to tune the model complexity carefully, just like in [[Supervised Learning]]! 
We will derive the method as an extension to [[K-Means]] clustering.
