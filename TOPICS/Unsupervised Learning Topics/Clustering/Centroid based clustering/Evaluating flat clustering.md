- Consider the value of $J$, useful to compare runs with different hyperparameters:
   $+$ $\frac{J}{N}$ is the mean squared error of replacing all points with their cluster mean.
   $-$ No idea how "compact" the clusters are.
  
- If you have a labelled dataset, you can see how well the clustering recovers a known label.
