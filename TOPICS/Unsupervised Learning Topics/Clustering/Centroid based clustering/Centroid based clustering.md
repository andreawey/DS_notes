[[Clustering]]

Idea: represent each cluster by a single vector (usually the centroid, i.e. the mean vector)

• basic method for flat clustering
• clusters (usually) represented by their centroid vector
• hard clustering: each data point belongs to exactly one cluster
• soft clustering: data points may belong to several clusters (usually, the assignment is probabilistic, i.e. the assignments are weighted between 0.0 and 1.0 and sum up to one)
