In hierarchical [[Clustering]], one considers a hierarchy of clusters, usually represented in form of a tree
(dendrogram). Idea: create a tree which represents similarity between data subsets hierarchically.
The less you have to “climb” the tree in order to get from one element to another, the more similar
they are.
