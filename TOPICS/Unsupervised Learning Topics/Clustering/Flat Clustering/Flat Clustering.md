in flat [[Clustering]], there is only one level of clusters, all clusters are equally important.

- Usually the samples are given as vectors in the RD. In this case, we need a [[Distance measures]] between two samples, and a objective criterion which determines how we cluster.
-  We may also need to measure the distance of a sample to a cluster.
-  Using suitable features or a suitable distance measure, clustering can also be applied to abstract objects (e.g. documents) to make their analysis tractable!
- We also may wish to consider how to assign new samples to existing clusters
