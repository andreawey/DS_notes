[[Recommender Systems]]

[[Neural Networks]] models can be applied in content-based RS in a variety of ways. User and item embeddings can be the input of a neural network of any architecture, which then yields the desired classification or regression output.

It is also feasible to continuously tune a system.

### Major technical difficulty:
- Sparsity of interaction data.
- Possible overfitting to any of the information sources.
