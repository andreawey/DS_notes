[[Recommender Systems]]

Collaborative filtering is based only on the interactions of users and items. No further information about users and items is explicitly collected. 
Match users with similar characteristics.

## Problems
- cold start 
- sparse user matrix 
- need minimum number of common points to be close users 
- very sensitive to new data and hence outliers 
- Scales badly. But when it works well gives good personalized recommendations.
