[[Collaborative Filtering]]

Match users with similar characteristics. 
Collect interactions in the Interactions matrix.
For performing a recommendation, search for similar users, and recommend based on the aggregated preferences of those users!

• Require a minimum number of interactions,
• Very sensitive since each user usually has only interacted with few items,
• Suffers from the cold-start,
• Gives very personalized results.

Advanced user-user systems can be implemented using neural networks.
