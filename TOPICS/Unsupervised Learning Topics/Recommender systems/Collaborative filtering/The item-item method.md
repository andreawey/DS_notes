[[Collaborative Filtering]]

Match items with similar characteristics. Same interactions matrix. 
For performing a recommendation, take the n most popular items of the user, and search for similar items based on (positive and negative) ratings of different users.

• Only works for users who already have interacted with some items,
• More robust than the [[The user-user method]],
• Suffers from the cold-start,
• Less personalized than user-user.
