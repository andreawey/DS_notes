For unsupervised learning, it’s not easy to define the learning criteria.

• Usually, we optimize some surrogate learning criterion which can be formalized as some mathematical function.

• There are many ways to define this function, depending on what we want to achieve (discover structure, visualize data, represent samples compactly, suppress noise, . . . )

• Evaluating the quality of the result can be quite difficult and is very application-dependent.
