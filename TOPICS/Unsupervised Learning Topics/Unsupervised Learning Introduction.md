Unsupervised Learning is Machine Learning based on unannotated input data, i.e. input data

without corresponding targets. Goals of unsupervised learning are:
• obtain insights into the structure of the data
• discover hidden and interesting patterns
• learn representations with specific properties.

This is in strong contrast to supervised learning, where we fundamentally aim at learning a function
f : data → targets. In supervised learning, we always have an independent test set, and we aim
at generalization. In unsupervised learning, we might also want to discover structure on a fixed
dataset. (But there are also plenty of situations where new, unseen data is involved.)
